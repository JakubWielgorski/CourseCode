However  it does have a sklearn API. Also changed learner enum to specify a new boolean to control whether or not the model variable should be cleared in python after training and each call to distributionsForInstances. This allows conservation of memory on the host and potentially on devices (e.g. xgboost compiled for GPU). The downside is an overhead with transmitting the model back into python for each batch prediction.
